# Basic React Weather App
This is a simple, not extensive, example of a React developed weather app using:
- [Foundation 6 for sites](https://foundation.zurb.com/) responsive front-end framework
- [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/) weather API
- [Skycons](https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/) canvas animated weather icons
- [MomentJS](https://momentjs.com/) Date parsing library

All of these packages are using a React ported version of their scripts.


## Basic installation
Just like every node package manager install you just run

```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```

and let the appropriate packages install.


### How to Run
Please Note: You must define your `.env` and `.env.server` variables by copying the `.env.example` and `.env.server.example` files and registering for a [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev/) developer account first before attempting to run the server.


In the project directory, you can run:
```
npm run build
```
```
npm run server
```

Runs the app in the production mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.
